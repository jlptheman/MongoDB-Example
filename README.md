A very basic REST web API, written in both Java 8 and .Net Core, to demonstrate the basic usage of MongoDB.

WIP

Usage:
1. Start the app
   - Java: Open the pom file in Intellij and hit run
   - .NetCore: Open in Visual Studio 2019 and hit run (ensure web project is the startup project)
2. Open Postman, import collection from Postman directory and interact using the REST enpoints provided!
